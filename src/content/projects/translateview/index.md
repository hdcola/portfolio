This is a library for SwiftUI applications on iOS 15 and later versions that makes it very easy to use the built-in iOS translation feature. Before Apple officially opened this API to developers in 2024, this was the only way to use the built-in translation feature in your app. The library is very simple to use and requires only a few lines of code to implement translation functionality. You can choose the language to translate to and the direction of translation. The library also supports translation callbacks, allowing you to perform actions after the translation is complete.
