Don't be surprised that I was an accountant. I took this job because I studied accounting, and I thought it was the best way to learn the language and integrate into this new country. Although I worked at this company for a short time, I learned a lot. I learned how to work in this country, how to get along with colleagues, and how to communicate with clients. I am very grateful to this company for giving me this opportunity to learn so much. However, as a programmer, I still prefer coding. So, in addition to completing my job, I also helped the company streamline the entire process from delivery to payment and refund, and even developed a series of tools to help all colleagues in this position perform better. This job gave me a better understanding of the company's operations and my own abilities.

- Completed the company's payment and refund tasks
- Used self-made software to automate the reconciliation and accounting of ERP/CRM with cash, checks, and online payments (Swift/SwiftUI/Python/JavaScript/UserScript)
- Used self-made software to automate the identification and processing of customer refund emails (Python/Quickbook Online API/OpenAI API/Telegram Bot API)
- Achieved a tenfold increase in daily accounting efficiency
